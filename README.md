# OpenAI Telegram Bot

This is a simple Python program that uses the OpenAI API to generate text and images based on user input, and sends the results to a Telegram bot.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/leop25/openai-telegram.git

2. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set the required environment variables:
    - `API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
    - `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token

## Usage

To run the bot, simply run the `main.py` script:
python main.py

Once the bot is running, you can interact with it by sending messages to it on Telegram. Use the `/text` command followed by a prompt to generate text, or use the `/image` command followed by a prompt to generate an image.
